The UE[BR[1]  initiates the TAU procedure by sending[BR[2] , to the eNodeB[BR[3] , a TAU Request[BR[4]  (UE Core Network Capability, MS Network Capability, Preferred Network behaviour, Support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage, old GUTI, Old GUTI type, last visited TAI, active flag, signalling active flag, EPS bearer status, P‑TMSI Signature, additional GUTI, eKSI, NAS sequence number, NAS-MAC, KSI, Voice domain preference and UE's usage setting[BR[5] ) message together with RRC parameters indicating the Selected Network[BR[6]  and the old GUMMEI[BR[7]  An exception is that, if the TAU was triggered for load re-balancing purposes[BR[8]  (see clause 4.3.7.3[BR[9] ), the old GUMMEI[BR[10]  is not included[BR[11]  in the RRC parameters[BR[12] . The UE[BR[13]  shall set[BR[14] [BR[15]  the Old GUTI Type to indicate whether the Old GUTI is a native GUTI[BR[16]  or is mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI[BR[17] .
If the UE[BR[18] 's TIN indicates "GUTI"[BR[19]  or "RAT‑related TMSI[BR[20] " and the UE holds a valid GUTI[BR[21]  then the old GUTI indicates[BR[22] [BR[23]  this valid GUTI[BR[24] . If the UE's TIN indicates "P‑TMSI"[BR[25]  and the UE[BR[26]  holds a valid P‑TMSI and related RAI[BR[27]  then these two elements are indicated[BR[28]  as the old GUTI[BR[29] . Mapping a P‑TMSI and RAI to a GUTI is specified in Annex H[BR[30] . When the UE is in connected mode (e.g. in URA_PCH) when it reselects to E‑UTRAN[BR[31] , the UE[BR[32]  shall set[BR[33]  its TIN to "P‑TMSI"[BR[34] .
