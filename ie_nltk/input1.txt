If the UE[BR[18] 's TIN indicates "GUTI"[BR[19]  or "RAT‑related TMSI[BR[20] " and the UE holds a valid GUTI[BR[21]  then the old GUTI indicates[BR[22] [BR[23]  this valid GUTI[BR[24] . If the UE's TIN indicates "P‑TMSI"[BR[25]  and the UE[BR[26]  holds a valid P‑TMSI and related RAI[BR[27]  then these two elements are indicated[BR[28]  as the old GUTI[BR[29] . Mapping a P‑TMSI and RAI to a GUTI is specified in Annex H[BR[30] . When the UE is in connected mode (e.g. in URA_PCH) when it reselects to E‑UTRAN[BR[31] , the UE[BR[32]  shall set[BR[33]  its TIN to "P‑TMSI"[BR[34] .
