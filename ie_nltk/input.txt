The present document defines the Stage?2 service description for the Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched Domain - also known as the Evolved Packet System (EPS) in this document. The Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched Domain provides IP connectivity using the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN).
The specification covers both roaming and non-roaming scenarios and covers all aspects, including mobility between E-UTRAN and pre-E-UTRAN 3GPP radio access technologies, policy control and charging, and authentication.
The Radio Access Network functionality is documented only to the extent necessary to describe the overall system. TS?36.300?[5] contains the overall description of the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN).
ITU-T Recommendation I.130?[3] describes a three-stage method for characterisation of telecommunication services, and ITU-T Recommendation Q.65?[4] defines Stage?2 of the method.
TS?23.402?[2] is a companion specification to this specification.
